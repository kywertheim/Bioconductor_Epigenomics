# EpigenomicsBioconductor
Context: I wrote the R script named 'HW1.R' for the first assignment of the Coursera course entitled 'Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science'.

About:
1. The R script uses the AnnotationHub package to obtain data on human CpG islands and histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3).
2. The R script uses the GenomicRanges package to extract basic statistics from the data by performing operations such as grouping ranges by chromosome, subsetting, intersecting, finding range overlaps, resizing ranges, creating a contingency table, and calculating an odds ratio.

Software:
1. R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15).
2. Bioconductor version 3.12.
3. AnnotationHub.
4. GenomicRanges.
5. rtracklayer.
